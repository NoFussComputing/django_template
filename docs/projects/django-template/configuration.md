This page details the configuration for setting up the application.



## Single Sign-On

- `SSO_ENABLED`, boolean

Single Sign on (SSO) is made possible through the [social django application](https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/django.html). Specific configuration for the backend that you would like to configure can be viewed within it's [documentation](https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/index.html). In most cases the only configuration will need to be done for the following attributes: `SSO_ENABLED`, `SSO_BACKENDS` and `SOCIAL_AUTH_`.

!!! danger
    Within the social django documentation, it will state the the configuration key for the backends is within attribute `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`, don't use this attribute. Instead use attribute `SSO_BACKENDS` so as not to effect the authentication of the ITSM application.


### Example SSO Configuration

Attributes with prefix `SSO_` are specifically for this application.

``` py

SSO_ENABLED = True             # Optional, boolean. Enable SSO Authentication

SSO_BACKENDS = (               # this attribute replaces `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` and must be used instead of.
    "social_core.backends.open_id_connect.OpenIdConnectAuth",
)

# Example configuration for the openid connect backend
SOCIAL_AUTH_OIDC_OIDC_ENDPOINT = 'https://<domain name>/realms/<realm name>'
SOCIAL_AUTH_OIDC_KEY = '<client key>'
SOCIAL_AUTH_OIDC_SECRET = '<client secret>'
# SOCIAL_AUTH_OIDC_SCOPE = ['groups']
# SOCIAL_AUTH_OIDC_IGNORE_DEFAULT_SCOPE = True # default scopes: “openid”, “profile” and “email”

```


## Available Settings

Below are the available configuration values along with their default value.

``` py

DEBUG = False                    # SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!
SSO_ENABLED = False              # Enable SSO

```
